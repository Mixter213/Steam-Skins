Steam-Skins

This Repo is for the purpose of Keeping track of my testing with steam skins.
Take a look at the Wiki im woring on :D https://github.com/Mixter213/Steam-Skins/wiki

In Testering Mk5 I a deleted all content within the layout files, and slowly adding back in the parts that i know do something. this will cause issues in the future, but will also remove all the obsolete code that is here.
